They were also ill-suited for airship\nuse, as barrels sturdy enough to withstand the firing of cannonballs were also\nextremely heavy.\n \nIn order to bypass these inconveniences, the ether cannon was invented. This\nartillery piece is capable of firing as long as its barrel holds and there's ether\nenergy to be had—no loading required.\n \nThough a shot from an ether cannon will be both slower and weaker than one\nfrom a gunpowder cannon of the same caliber, the ether model is still extremely\ndestructive. It is capable of shooting a continuous beam at one target, instigating\na rapid buildup of thermodynamic energy. Shots do not arc, as cannonballs do,\nbut rather fly in a straight line. This makes ether cannons easy to manipulate and\nespecially suited for airborne battle, where targets may dodge up or down, as\nwell as in the four cardinal directions, at high speeds.\n \nThis new form of ordnance, however, is not without its faults; the barrel, for\nexample, is extremely prone to overheating after rapid fire. But given its\nremarkable compatibility with airships, it may be safely assumed that the ether\ncannon is the heavy artillery piece of the future.\""
