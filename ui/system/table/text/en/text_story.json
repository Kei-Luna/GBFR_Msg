I crafted them a long time ago using\nspecial metal alloys (sorry, that's a trade secret). I'm\nconfident my pieces will withstand a ton of punishment but\nonly if you observe proper maintenance.\n \nLet's start with the sword. It'll get chipped in tough\nbattles, there's no way around it. You probably already knew\nthis, but keep the blade sharpened. Any old whetstone will\ndo, so long as you're gentle. After that, you should treat\nthe blade with high-quality camellia oil produced by the\nsmithies in Seedhollow. It's not cheap, but it's worth the\nprice. Finally, don't forget to wipe off excess oil with an\nantique cloth.\n \nNow for the armor. Frequent polishing with oil and a metal\nbrush is a must. The exterior is chemically treated with\nmelamite to prevent rust, but that coating can get scraped\noff in extreme combat. Scrub off any rust immediately with a\nmetal brush and oil, or else it'll spread like mold. Oh, and\nmake sure it's Dahli 566. That's a high-performing\nall-purpose oil that was manufactured on Dahli Island,\nthough no one knows how to make it anymore. I got you\nstarted with a small bottle, but you ought to stock up from\na trader if you can.\n \nIf you need additional help, take your gear to a smithy in\nFolca or Seedhollow. It's not free, of course, but some\nsituations call for an expert's touch."

People were blown away (no pun intended) by the huge\nether artillery models that entered last year's market. This\ncreates a vicious feedback loop: ships pack on more armor\nand bulk to protect against heavier shells, guns get bigger\nto compensate, and costs go up across the board.\n \nEnter the latest model of carronade-style ether cannons,\nwhich crams the same firepower into a compact, sleek design\nthat facilitates longer sustained fire. They're also easier\nto install and maintain. So although smaller ships have less\narmor and smaller payloads, a fleet of speedy fighters can\nrule the skies through maneuverability and numbers.\n \nObviously a cannon is pointless if it blows up its user.\nThanks to alloys of red gigas steel and damascus grains,\nthese gun batteries won't explode even if the ship goes up\nin flames. They also have built-in fail-safes in case of\noverheating.\n \nBy the very nature of being mechanics, I know some of you\ndon't have a positive opinion of ether cannons. Weapons are\nweapons; that's completely understandable. However,\nconsidering how essential an airship is, I believe some form\nof self-defense is deserved.
